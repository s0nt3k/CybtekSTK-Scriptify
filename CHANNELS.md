Recommended Channel Settings
When installing MS Office on a business information system I highly recommend you choose the Semi-Anual Enterprise channel, and for businesses classified as financial institutions according to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 better known as the Financial Modernization Act requiring business to comply with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 setting the servicing channel to Simi-Anual Enterprise is not a recommendation is a requirements..

Here’s when SAEC makes sense for a small business:

Stability first. New features arrive only twice a year (planned for January and July), which reduces surprise UI changes that confuse staff or disrupt add-ins your team relies on (DocuSign, transaction-management, MLS tools, etc.).
Predictable change windows. You can plan training and testing around two known dates rather than chasing monthly changes. Security fixes still come every month, so you’re not trading away safety.
Locked-down or shared PCs. Devices used by many users (front desk, kiosks, conference rooms, VDI) benefit from long, quiet periods between feature updates. Microsoft is explicitly steering SAEC toward these unattended/special-purpose devices.
Important 2025 changes you should know before choosing SAEC:

Starting July 2025, each SAEC feature release is supported for 6 months, plus a 2-month rollback window (effective 8-month span). That’s a shorter lifecycle than before, so you’ll need to update twice a year on schedule.
SAEC (Preview) was deprecated. For pre-testing, Microsoft recommends using Monthly Enterprise Channel (MEC) as the release candidate path.
When SAEC is not a great fit:

Interactive users who want features sooner (e.g., Copilot enhancements, new Outlook/Excel capabilities). Microsoft now recommends MEC or Current Channel for most user-facing devices.
You can’t commit to doing the twice-yearly upgrade rhythm (you must keep up, given the new 6+2-month cycle). (directionsonmicrosoft.com)
Practical rollout tip:

Put receptionist/kiosk/meeting-room/VDI machines on SAEC for quiet stability.
Keep agents’ laptops and staff machines on MEC, and use its monthly release-candidate to validate what’s coming to SAEC. This mirrors Microsoft’s current guidance and gives you an easy test path.
Bottom line: Use SAEC for locked-down or shared systems where stability and low change are paramount; use MEC/Current for day-to-day user devices that benefit from newer features. This split keeps your brokerage productive while minimizing training and break-fix churn.2)
